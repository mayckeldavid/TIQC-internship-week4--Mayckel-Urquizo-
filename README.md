📄 README.md — Week 4 (TIQC Internship)
Author: Mayckel Urquizo
Project: Week 4 – Problem Definition & Ideation
🔍 Problem Statement

Small restaurants in Queens often lose customers because wait-times are unclear, especially during peak hours. This creates frustration, cancellations, negative reviews, and ultimately lower daily revenue. Owners lack simple digital tools to communicate estimated wait-times in real time.

🧠 SWOT Analysis (FODA)

A SWOT diagram was created to understand internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats.

Strengths: loyal customers, high demand, experienced staff
Weaknesses: no digital tools, manual order handling, inconsistent communication
Opportunities: customer transparency expectations, low-cost digital tools, NYC small business programs
Threats: competition with advanced systems, rising costs, negative reviews

🌳 Mind Map

A mind map was created to explore causes, stakeholders, constraints, existing alternatives, and solution themes related to unclear wait-times.

🤖 AI-Refined Idea Map

Using ChatGPT (LLM), the initial mind map was refined by grouping similar ideas, removing duplicates, expanding weak branches, and stress-testing feasibility.

Prompt used:

You are a product strategist. Refine and reorganize this idea map about:
“Small restaurants in Queens losing customers because wait-times are unclear.”

1. Group similar ideas.
2. Remove duplicates.
3. Expand weak branches with 5–7 new insights.
4. Stress-test feasibility (cost, legal, adoption risk).
5. Output as a clean, structured idea map that I can paste into Canva.

📄 One-Page Concept Document

This one-page describes the final chosen concept:

Problem & Audience

Customers become frustrated due to unclear wait-times; restaurants lose revenue and reputation.

A simple dashboard for updating and displaying estimated wait-times in real time.
Success Metric: fewer cancellations + fewer complaints.

Why Now?

SWOT + mind map show a strong need for transparency and low-cost tools.

Risks & Assumptions

Staff must update times regularly

Requires stable WiFi

Owners must accept digital workflows

Next Step (Week 5 Validation)

Test a paper prototype showing: “Current Wait Time: __ minutes.”
